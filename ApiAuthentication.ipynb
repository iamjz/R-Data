    "OAuth authentication is the process in which users authorize access to an application without sharing their credentials. Instead of a user's credentials, OAuth uses tokens. There are two types of tokens. **Request tokens** are used by an app to request access from users.  Once authorized, the request token is exchanged for an access token, which is the second type of token. **Access tokens*** are used by an app to act on behalf of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "The OAuth authentication process is done in three steps:\n",
    "1. The app obtains an unauthorized request token.\n",
    "2. The user authorizes the request token.\n",
    "3. The app exchanges the request token for an access token."
