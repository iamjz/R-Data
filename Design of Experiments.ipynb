Then we find the average attention span for the 2 groups of people and compare. Based on the observational study, even if we find a difference between the average attention span of these groups of people, we can't attribute this difference solely to using screens because there may be other variables that we didn't control for this study that could've contributed to the observed difference. For example, people who use screens at night might also be using screens for longer period during the day and their attention span might be affected by the daytime usage as well. \n",

    "- **Experiment:** We sample a group of people from the population and then we randomly assign these people into 2 groups: those who are asked to use screens at bedtime and those asked not to use them. The difference is that the decision to use or not use screens at bedtime is NOT left to the subject. Rather, it is imposed by the researcher. At the end, we compare the attention spans of the 2 groups. Such variables that might contribute to the outcome, called confounding variables, are most likely represented equally in the 2 groups due to random assignment. Therefore, if we find the difference between the 2 averages, we can indeed make a causal statement attributing this difference to bedtime screen usage. "

    "Why do we sample in the first place? Why not try to collect data from the entire population of interest? You could try to take a census but it isn't easy. First, taking a census requires a lot more resources than collecting data from a sample of the population. Second, certain individuals in your population might be hard to locate or collect data from. If these individuals that are missed in the census are different from those in the rest of the population, the census data will be biased. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the US census, illegal immigrants are often not recorded properly since they tend to be reluctant to fill out census forms with the concern that this information could be shared with immigrantion. However, these individuals might have characteristics different from the rest of the population and hence, not getting information from them might result in unreliable data from geographical regions with high concentrations of illegal immigrants. Lastly, populations are constantly changing. Even if you do have the required resources and manage to collect data from everyone in the population, your population will be different tomorrow and so the hard work required to collect such data may not pay off.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample is natural\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think about it, sampling is actually quite natural. Think about something you are cooking. We taste or in other words examine a small part of what we're cooking to get an idea about the dish as a whole. Afterall, we would never eat a whole pot of soup just to check its taste. When you taste a spoonful of soup and decide the spoonful you tasted isn't salty enough, what you're doing is simply explanatory analysis for the sample at hand. If you then generalize and conclude that your entire soup needs salt, that's making an inference. For your inference to be valid, the spoonful you tasted (your sample), needs to be representative of the entire pot (your population). If your spoonful comes only from the surface and the salt is collected at the bottom, what you tasted is probably not going to be representative of the whole pot. On the other hand, if you first stir the soup thoroughly before you taste, your spoonful will more likely be representative of the whole pot. \n",
    "\n",
    "Sampling data is a bit different than sampling soup though. Let's introduce a few commonly used sampling methods: \n",

    "* Simple random sampling\n",
    "* Stratified sampling\n",
    "* Cluster sampling\n",
    "* Multistage sampling"

    "### Simple random sampling\n",
    "We randomly select cases from the population, such that each case is equally likely to be selected. This is similar to randomly drawing names from a hat. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Stratified sampling\n",
    "We first divide the population into homogeneous groups called strata and then we randomly sample from within each stratum. For example, if we wanted to make sure that people from low, medium, and high socioeconomic status are equally represented in a study, we would first divide our population into 3 groups as such and then sample from within each group. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cluster sampling\n",
    "In cluster sampling, we divide the population into clusters, randomly sample a few clusters, and then sample all observations within these clusters. The clusters, unlike strata in stratified sampling, are heterogeneous within themselves and each cluster is similar to the others, such that we can get away with sampling from just a few of the clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Multistage sampling\n",
    "Multistage sampling adds another steps to cluster sampling. Just like in cluster sampling, we divide the population into clusters, randomly sample a few clusters, and then we randomly sample observations from within those clusters. \n",
    "\n",
    "...\n",
    "\n",
    "Cluster and multistage sampling are often used from economical reasons. One might divide a city into geographic regions that are on average similar to each other and then sample randomly from a few randomly picked regions in order to avoid travelling to all regions. "
