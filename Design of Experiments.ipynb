    "- **Observational Study:** We sample 2 types of people from the population. Those who choose to use screens at bedtime and those who don't. Then we find the average attention span for the 2 groups of people and compare. Based on the observational study, even if we find a difference between the average attention span of these groups of people, we can't attribute this difference solely to using screens because there may be other variables that we didn't control for this study that could've contributed to the observed difference. For example, people who use screens at night might also be using screens for longer period during the day and their attention span might be affected by the daytime usage as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Experiment:** We sample a group of people from the population and then we randomly assign these people into 2 groups: those who are asked to use screens at bedtime and those asked not to use them. The difference is that the decision to use or not use screens at bedtime is NOT left to the subject. Rather, it is imposed by the researcher. At the end, we compare the attention spans of the 2 groups. Such variables that might contribute to the outcome, called confounding variables, are most likely represented equally in the 2 groups due to random assignment. Therefore, if we find the difference between the 2 averages, we can indeed make a causal statement attributing this difference to bedtime screen usage. "
